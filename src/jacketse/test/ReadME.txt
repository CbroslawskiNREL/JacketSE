Here beside the test file, I have added some MP based files that were used to compare utilizations between mine and Andrews.
On 10/14 I discovered that the new version of tower supplement actually returns utilization whereas before it was returning utilization-1. 
THis led to the fix in Utilization.py where '+1' had to be removed from tower utilizations. Everytihng run before this time is fine, don't worry.

Also there is an example from Katherine's test folder in case I need to expand the test_jacketSE.py file.
